# 🚀 React Practice Projects

This repository contains my React practice projects — small to medium-sized apps built to improve my React.js skills and strengthen my frontend development fundamentals.  
Each project is made using **React + Vite**, with modern JavaScript (ES6+) and clean UI design.

## 🧠 Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of React fundamentals  
- Practice real-world UI layouts and interactivity  
- Improve project structuring and component reusability  
- Build consistency and version control discipline using GitHub
